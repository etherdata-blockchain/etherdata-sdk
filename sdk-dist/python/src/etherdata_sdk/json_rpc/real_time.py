    Getd v1
    4 and later support publish / subscribe using JSON-RPC notifications
      This allows clients to wait for events instead of polling for them

    It works by subscribing to particular events
     The node will return a subscription id
      For each event that matches the subscription a notification with relevant data is send toGetder  with the subscription id

    Considerations 1
     Notifications are sent for current events and not for past events
     If your use case requires  you not to miss any notifications than subscriptions are probably not the best option
     2
     Subscriptions require a full duplex connection
     Getd offers such connections in the form of  WebSocket and IPC (enabled by default)
     3
     Subscriptions are coupled to a connection
     If the connection is closed all subscriptions that  are created over this connection are removed
     4
     Notifications are stored in an internal buffer and sent from this buffer to the client
     If the  client is unable to keep up and the number of buffered notifications reaches a  limit (currently 10k) the connection is closed
     Keep in mind that subscribing to some events  can cause a flood of notifications, e
