/**
* Getd v1
* 4 and later support publish / subscribe using JSON-RPC notifications
*   This allows clients to wait for events instead of polling for them
* 
It works by subscribing to particular events
*  The node will return a subscription id
*   For each event that matches the subscription a notification with relevant data is send toGetder  with the subscription id
* 
Considerations 1
*  Notifications are sent for current events and not for past events
*  If your use case requires  you not to miss any notifications than subscriptions are probably not the best option
*  2
*  Subscriptions require a full duplex connection
*  Getd offers such connections in the form of  WebSocket and IPC (enabled by default)
*  3
*  Subscriptions are coupled to a connection
*  If the connection is closed all subscriptions that  are created over this connection are removed
*  4
*  Notifications are stored in an internal buffer and sent from this buffer to the client
*  If the  client is unable to keep up and the number of buffered notifications reaches a  limit (currently 10k) the connection is closed
*  Keep in mind that subscribing to some events  can cause a flood of notifications, e
* g
*  listening for all logs/blocks when the node starts to  synchronize
