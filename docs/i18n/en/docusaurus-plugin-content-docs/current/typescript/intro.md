# Introduction

> API documentation and code implementation was generated by our typescript generator. Please submit any issue on GitHub

This SDK has been published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/etherdata-typescript)

## Installation
```shell
npm i etherdata-typescript
```
OR

```shell
yarn add etherdata-typescript
```

## Import

The default export is using ES6 style

```typescript
export { Admin,Clique,Debug,Etd,Personal,Real_time,Txpool,Json_rpc,Json_rpc_methods,Miner, }
```

You can import our library in typescript or ES6 JS using
```typescript
import { Json_rpc_methods } from "etherdata-typescript";
```

You can import our library in commonJS like this
```js
const { Json_rpc_methods } = require("etherdata-typescript")
```

## Usage

You need to initialize our API client first with the remote URL. All exported methods has a type definitions 
which will provide you an autocompletion while you are typing (in typescript). The following example shows how
to get the latest block by hash.

```typescript
const rpc = new Json_rpc_methods(url);
const block = await rpc.getBlockByHash(id, false);
```

And the returns block has the following type definition.

```typescript
export interface GetBlockByHashResponseObj {
  number: string;
  hash: string;
  parnetHash: string;
  nonce: string;
  sha3Uncles: string;
  logsBloom: string;
  transactionsRoot: string;
  miner: string;
  difficulty: string;
  totalDifficulty: string;
  extraData: string;
  size: string;
  gasLimit: string;
  gasUsed: string;
  timestamp: string;
  transaction: string[];
  uncles: string[];
}
```
