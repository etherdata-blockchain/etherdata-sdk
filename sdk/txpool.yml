description: "The txpool API gives you access to several non-standard RPC methods to inspect the contents of 
              the transaction pool containing all the currently pending transactions as well as the ones queued 
              for future processing."
            
functions:
  - name: content
    description: The content inspection property can be queried to list the exact details of all the 
                 transactions currently pending for inclusion in the next block(s), as well as the ones that are 
                 being scheduled for future execution only.

                 The result is an object with two fields pending and queued. Each of these fields are 
                 associative arrays, in which each entry maps an origin-address to a batch of scheduled 
                 transactions. These batches themselves are maps associating nonces with actual transactions.

                 Please note, there may be multiple transactions associated with the same account and nonce. 
                 This can happen if the user broadcast mutliple ones with varying gas 
                 allowances (or even complerely different transactions).
